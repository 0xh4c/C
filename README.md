#  C Notes for Malware Development

This repo contains my C programming notes and code â€” focused on:

- Malware development
- Reverse engineering
- Memory exploitation

---

##  Why C?

C gives direct access to memory and system internals â€” making it perfect for:

- Writing custom payloads
- Understanding stack/heap behavior
- Exploiting low-level bugs

---

##  Goal

Build a solid C foundation for advanced topics like:
- Buffer overflows
- Shellcode writing
- Windows/Linux malware

---

Work in progress ðŸ”§ â€” more coming soon.
